To start the local server, do the following:
    1) cd into the "server" directory
    2) type "node app.js"

To start the client-side app, type the following:
    1) "cd classifier-app"
    2) "npm start"

To get it to work, you may need to do the following installations:
    1) yarn add @material-ui/core
    2) yarn add react-bootstrap
    3) npm install react-scripts@1.1.1
    4) npm install python-shell
    5) npm install typeface-roboto --save
    6) pip install --upgrade gensim

For Isaac and Xingchen, to integrate your python classifiers with the web app,
you can do the following:

1) Navigate to the directory classifier-app/src/server
2) Copy your Python script into the folder classifierPythonScripts
3) Modify your Python script to write its output (classification and keywords
   used to make the classification) to the file, output.json. To do this,
   you should be able to reuse the writeClassificationToJsonFile() function at
   the bottom of owlClassifier.py.
4) Navigate to the directory server/classifierRouterHelperModules. In this directory,
   you should see a file corresponding to the classifier you are integrating.
5) Modify the content of this file in the following ways:
    a) If needed, change "args" so that it reflects the arguments passed into your classifier
       (right now it passes in the transcript text, so if that's all you need,
        you shouldn't need to change args).
    b) In the PythonShell.run() command, change the name of the classifier script
       to be run (it's currently set as "owlClassifier.py", but you should change
       it to the name of your Python classifier file).
